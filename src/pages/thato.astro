            <h1><br>Thato Makatu</h1>
            <p>My research project is centered around the object of the burglar bar and is developed to explore curatorial methodologies that center familial networks as a mode of learning. During my fieldwork in QwaQwa, Free State, I encountered ditema and morella, which are traditional Basotho architectural features. These features act similarly to Ndebele mural painting, as a home-making process usually enacted by women—often newlyweds—and taught by grandmothers and mothers.<br><br>
                My virtual curation incorporates these features on a house in the distance, with the distance serving as a purposeful reference to the initial object of the burglar bar and its function as a security feature that restricts access. While researching, I faced obstacles in accessing information due to my inability to speak Sesotho. However, this became easier to navigate as I increasingly relied on and included my mother and uncles as collaborators in my research methodology. They played a key role in the development of this work.<br><br>
                This led to my focus on ditema and morella as home-making practices that are part of my heritage. I created a virtual curation that places this still somewhat inaccessible practice in a space familiar to me: the Fika-Patso dam in QwaQwa, Free State.</p>
