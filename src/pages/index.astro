			<h1>Virtual Display</h1>
		
			<p>
				In this course, students were required to think critically about the act of curating in the virtual domain. They were expected to take into account not only the context of this space, but also the objects/artworks discussed or exhibited as part of their research, investigating different taxonomies and displays, as well as various possible approaches to interpretation. A historical overview of the virtual (from the panorama and diorama to current artistic and curatorial practices in the virtual realm) were paired with Practical: and successful strategies of artists, curators and gallerists using social networking as a tool for increasing global visibility and community outreach. The elective resulted in the translation of the studentâ€™s research project into an online curatorial platform.
