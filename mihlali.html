                <h3>The Panorama as an archive: Curating Black Memory in the Virtual Space</h3>
                <p>Mihlali Mabo</p>
                <p>The virtual curation I designed is a curation that intersects critically with my research interests. 
My research is concerned with the ontological resonances between the San rock art of the 
Eastern Cape Drakensberg and contemporary Black painting in Southern Africa. It particularly 
focuses on bodies that refuse notions of closure and looks into Black figuration and abstraction 
as ontological necessity. The research thesis comparatively examines rock art panels that span 
over 30,000 years and contemporary abstract and figurative painters, such as Dumile Feni and 
Portia Zvavahera. Through this analysis, I argue that these art practices bear similar formal 
characteristics, a practice that embodies a sense of resistance. In both these practices, they alter 
the figures in ways that they appear fragmented, dissolved, multi-layered and anatomically 
distorted. These effects are not only stylistically familiar but are grounded in navigating similar 
ontological conditions. Theoretically, it grounds the research in Timothy Morton’s concept of 
hyperobjects, where he states that hyperobjects are entities distributed in time or space far 
beyond human scale and comprehension. In addition, it considers Umberto Eco’s theory of 
open works, which posits that artworks are structurally resistant to ideas of closure and rely on 
subsequent participation for ongoing completion. Essentially, my research aims to demonstrate 
that the colonial rupture attempted to temporally dislocate Black indigenous art practices. This 
evidence is displayed in the San rock art being relegated to a ‘primitive’ past while 
simultaneously continuing this practice in the contemporary with Black abstraction and 
figuration being framed as ‘emerging’ from European modernity. However, the thesis argues 
that this attempt was thwarted because the epistemological rupture could not sever the 
ontological entanglement. </p>
